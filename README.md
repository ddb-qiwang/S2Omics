S2Omics is an end-to-end workflow that automatically selects regions of interest for spatial omics experiments using histology images. Additionally, S2Omics utilizes the resulting spatial omics data to virtually reconstruct spatial molecular profiles across entire tissue sections, providing valuable insights to guide subsequent experimental steps. Our histology image-guided design significantly reduces experimental costs while preserving critical spatial molecular variations, thereby making spatial omics studies more accessible and cost-effective.
